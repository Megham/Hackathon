<div class="section_header">what is hackathon? </div>

<p>wiki says...</p>
<p><i>A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which computer programmers and others in the field of software development, collaborate intensively on software-related projects and develop a usable product. Hackathons typically last between a day and a week in length. Some hackathons are intended simply for educational or social purposes, although in many cases the goal is to create usable software, or to improve existing software. Hackathons usually have no restrictions on the type of software being created.

<div class="section_header">stories about facebook hackathon</div>
<p>Facebook’s Timeline originally started as a hackathon project and evolved into completely changing the way the profile pages look today.First, the project commenced with a four-person team consisting of two full-time engineers, an engineering intern, and a designer. Together, they managed to build a working demo in a single night!!!<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/facebook-outlines-history-infrastructure-behind-timeline/66313" class="reference">[reference]</a>

In past years, Facebook Hackathons have been the starting point for all sorts of new features that rapidly became mainstays of the site, such as Facebook Chat, internationalization, the type-ahead feature in search, the friend suggester, etc. etc. Not every experiment pays off right away, but it’s a low-risk, high-reward setting that encourages engineers to bring to life some of the great ideas that are floating around here.<a href="https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=31942383919" class="reference">[reference]</a></p>
